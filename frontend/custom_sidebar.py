frontend/custom_sidebar.py
-----------------------------
A Gmail/Drive-style collapsible sidebar "drawer" for EcoVision AI.

Ported from LearnMate AI's frontend/custom_sidebar.py. Only the
mechanism (how the drawer opens/closes) was reused as-is; branding was
swapped to EcoVision AI (🌎 toggle icon, emerald glow instead of violet)
and internal widget keys were renamed from the `lm_` prefix to `eco_` so
nothing in this codebase references LearnMate naming.

This does NOT touch EcoVision's routing or backend logic in any way: it
only repositions/animates Streamlit's own native sidebar (the one
Streamlit already auto-builds from the files in pages/) via CSS. No
pages were added, removed, or reordered, and no navigation link here is
hand-built — the drawer just slides the existing, unmodified nav in and
out of view.

How it works (read before touching this file)
------------------------------------------------
Streamlit provides no public API to resize, hide, or animate its own
sidebar - so a custom collapsible sidebar necessarily has to reach it via
CSS targeting Streamlit's own DOM. This file does exactly that, and ONLY
that: no JavaScript, no click simulation, no reading/writing Streamlit's
internal JS state, no iframe.

Why `position: fixed` + `transform`, not a width animation
-------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this file animated the sidebar's `width` between
0 and its normal value. That produced a partially-visible "sliver" bug:
Streamlit's actual sidebar/main layout isn't guaranteed to be sized
purely by that one CSS property (it may involve an inner content wrapper
with its own intrinsic width, or a CSS Grid track sized independently of
the section's own `width`) - so shrinking `width` alone didn't fully
match what the layout engine reserved space for.

`position: fixed` sidesteps that entirely: once an element is taken out
of the normal document flow, no grid/flexbox sizing algorithm affects it
anymore - it becomes an independent floating layer, and `transform:
translateX()` slides that whole layer (identical width at all times, so
nothing inside it "shrinks" or "clips") fully on/off screen. This is a
layout-independent technique, not dependent on which internal layout
model this particular Streamlit version uses.

Because the sidebar is no longer part of the flex/grid flow, main
content no longer reflows into its space automatically - so on desktop
this file also sets an explicit `margin-left` on the main content
container, toggled in sync with the same transition. On mobile, the
drawer instead overlays on top of the content (no margin shift), with a
tap-to-close backdrop - matching how the Gmail/Drive Android drawer
behaves.

The only Streamlit-internal selectors touched are:

    header[data-testid="stHeader"]           - Streamlit's native app
                                                header/toolbar/deploy/
                                                share bar. Hidden
                                                UNCONDITIONALLY, on every
                                                page, independent of the
                                                sidebar logic below (see
                                                _hide_streamlit_header()).
    section[data-testid="stSidebar"]         - the sidebar, repositioned
                                                fixed + slid via transform
                                                (or hidden outright when
                                                show_toggle=False)
    section[data-testid="stMain"], .main     - main content, margin-left
                                                animated on desktop only
    [data-testid="collapsedControl"],
    [data-testid="stSidebarCollapseButton"]  - Streamlit's own native
                                                collapse arrow, hidden
                                                (display:none) since our
                                                🌎 button replaces it
    .block-container                         - given a small top-padding
                                                reservation so the fixed
                                                toggle button (top-left)
                                                never overlaps EcoVision's
                                                existing page content in
                                                the closed state

EcoVision's sidebar content (Streamlit's own auto-generated page nav
list, built from the files in pages/) is completely untouched - nothing
is moved, rebuilt, or hand-authored; it's the same native sidebar,
merely repositioned/animated.

Two independent systems — do not conflate them
------------------------------------------------
(A) The native Streamlit header/toolbar (`header[data-testid="stHeader"]`)
    is purely cosmetic chrome Streamlit itself injects. It has nothing to
    do with the sidebar and is hidden the same way on every single page,
    unconditionally, via `_hide_streamlit_header()` below.
(B) The EcoVision custom 🌎 drawer/sidebar is a separate, app-specific
    navigation affordance. Its visibility is a per-page decision (hidden
    on the public landing page and on the standalone Login/Register
    pages; shown on every authenticated/internal page) controlled by the
    `show_toggle` argument to `render_custom_sidebar_controls()`.
Hiding (A) never hides, disables, or otherwise touches (B), and vice
versa — they share no selectors.

State
------
st.session_state["sidebar_open"] is the single source of truth (default
True). No JavaScript state, no browser storage - a plain Python boolean,
recomputed into CSS on every rerun.

        sidebar is position:fixed (out of flex flow — see module
        docstring), stMain is the sole remaining flex child of its
        parent and therefore already stretches to 100% of the viewport
        width on its own; adding margin-left on top of an already
        full-width box pushes its right edge that same distance PAST the
        viewport's right edge, which is exactly the overflow/clipping
        seen in the reported screenshots. Explicitly shrinking width by
        the same amount the content is shifted keeps the right edge
        anchored at the viewport edge instead of sliding off it, so
        content actually resizes to fill the remaining space rather than
